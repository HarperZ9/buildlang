# build-ecosystem brand assets

Current assets, rendered on 4 October 2026 from the shared art direction:

- `docs/art/hero-dark.svg`, `docs/art/hero-light.svg`: the README hero, 1280 x 480, text outlined from Hanken Grotesk and Conso.
- `docs/art/social.png`: the GitHub social preview, 1280 x 640.
- The mark: `docs/brand/mark-16.png`, `docs/brand/mark-32.png` and `docs/brand/mark-16.svg` (favicon sizes),
  `docs/brand/mark-64.png`, `docs/brand/mark-512.png` and `docs/brand/mark-tile.svg` (app and listing icons),
  `docs/brand/mark-light.svg` and `docs/brand/mark-dark.svg` (on a page, no tile).
- The lockups: `docs/brand/lockup-horizontal-light.svg`, `docs/brand/lockup-horizontal-dark.svg`,
  `docs/brand/lockup-stacked-light.svg` and `docs/brand/lockup-stacked-dark.svg`.
- `docs/art/receipts.json`: a `superstack.receipt/1` for every PNG, with the seed, the scene hash and the font hashes.

The seed is the repository name. The same seed gives the same SVG bytes.

The record below describes the previous brand render and stays as it was written.

## Previous render

- `build-ecosystem-mark.svg` — square logomark (constellation of six member
  nodes around a central hub). Use for avatars, favicons, and small
  placements.
- `build-ecosystem-hero.svg` — wide banner used at the top of the project
  README.

Palette: the marks use the Project Telos indigo (`#4636e8`) for the
connecting links, with each member node getting one accent color from the
Build family palette, on a near-black indigo ground (`#160c28`/`#0a0816`).
Assets are SVG so they scale cleanly; export to PNG only if a raster is
required.
