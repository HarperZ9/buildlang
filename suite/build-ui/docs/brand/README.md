# build-ui brand assets

Current assets, rendered on 4 October 2026 from the shared art direction:

- `docs/art/hero-dark.svg`, `docs/art/hero-light.svg`: the README hero, 1280 x 480, text outlined from Hanken Grotesk and Conso.
- `docs/art/social.png`: the GitHub social preview, 1280 x 640.
- The mark: `docs/brand/mark-16.png`, `docs/brand/mark-32.png` and `docs/brand/mark-16.svg` (favicon sizes),
  `docs/brand/mark-64.png`, `docs/brand/mark-512.png` and `docs/brand/mark-tile.svg` (app and listing icons),
  `docs/brand/mark-light.svg` and `docs/brand/mark-dark.svg` (on a page, no tile).
- The lockups: `docs/brand/lockup-horizontal-light.svg`, `docs/brand/lockup-horizontal-dark.svg`,
  `docs/brand/lockup-stacked-light.svg` and `docs/brand/lockup-stacked-dark.svg`.
- `docs/art/receipts.json`: a `superstack.receipt/1` for every PNG, with the seed, the scene hash and the font hashes.

The seed is the repository name. The same seed gives the same SVG bytes.

The record below describes the previous brand render and stays as it was written.

## Previous render

- `build-ui-mark.svg` - square logomark for avatars, favicons, and compact
  placements.
- `build-ui-hero.svg` - canonical wide banner used at the top of the project
  README. Its label describes Build UI as a binding-neutral Qt 6 theme and
  widget library.

The palette uses Project Telos indigo (`#4636e8`) with color-primary accents
(`#ff4d6d`, `#ffb84d`, `#38d39f`, `#4d8bff`) on a near-black indigo ground
(`#160c28`, `#0a0816`). SVG is the shipped source of truth so the assets scale
cleanly. Generate a raster externally only when a distribution surface requires
one; the repository does not retain a duplicate hero PNG.
